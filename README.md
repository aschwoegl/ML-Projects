Peano.py is a program that geographically sorts areas based on their longitude and latitude sorting similar to a Peano sort method. 
ClassifierProject is a project I completed for a machine learning Coursera course where I compared 4 different types (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Reg) of predictive models. 
The Boston_House.py file is a simple regression project that predicts the house value of homes in a Boston Housing data set.
KingCounty_House_Price is a regression project with different regression models that predict house price in King County and the R-squared values of each model.
