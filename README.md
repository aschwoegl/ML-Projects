Peano.py is a program that geographically sorts areas based on their longitude and latitude trying to sort similar to a Peano Sort method. 
Best classifier is a project I completed for a machine learning Coursera course where I compared 4 different types of predictive models. 
The Boston_House.py file is a simple regression project that predicts the house value of homes in a Boston Housing data set.
